Banking System Development â€“ Java

Developed a Java-based banking application as part of a personal project, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to simulate real-world banking operations. The system includes different account types like SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount, each with customized functionalities like interest calculations, balance management, and fee deductions.

Key features include:

Deposit and Withdrawal Functionality: Users can deposit funds and withdraw amounts while checking account balances.

Interest Calculation: The system calculates and applies interest for savings accounts based on an annual interest rate.

Fee Management: Monthly fees are applied to checking accounts, with automated deductions.

OOP Principles: Used inheritance and polymorphism to extend common functionalities and ensure code reusability and scalability.

The project helped solidify my understanding of Java, object-oriented programming, and banking system logic, preparing me for future development in financial software.
